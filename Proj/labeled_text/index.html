<method>YAKE</method>We introduce DeepProbLog, a <kw>neural probabilistic</kw> <kw>logic</kw> <kw>programming</kw> <kw>language</kw> that incorporates <kw>deep learning</kw> by means of neural predicates. We show how existing inference and <kw>learning</kw> techniques of the underlying <kw>probabilistic</kw> <kw>logic</kw> <kw>programming</kw> <kw>language ProbLog</kw> can be adapted for the new <kw>language</kw>. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that DeepProbLog supports (i) both symbolic and subsymbolic representations and inference, (ii) program induction, (iii) <kw>probabilistic</kw> (<kw>logic</kw>) <kw>programming</kw>, and (iv) (deep) <kw>learning</kw> from examples. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to propose a framework where general-purpose neural networks and expressive probabilistic-logical modeling and reasoning are integrated in a way that exploits the full expressiveness and strengths of both worlds and can be trained end-to-end based on examples.
